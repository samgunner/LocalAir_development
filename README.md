# LocalAir_development

This is the first version of the LocalAir microprocesser software, for use on the Teensy 4.0.

This version works, but is grim. A product version is currently under development.

## Setup

This project uses [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).

To get started, install either:

- [PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/index.html), a CLI tool, or
- [PlatformIO IDE](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/pioide.html), an integration with VS Code.

## Building

Either:

- Run `pio run --target upload`, if using PlatformIO Core (CLI), or
- Use the `PlatformIO: Upload` button in VS Code, if using PlatformIO IDE.
